\usage{
fastdigest(obj, ref_serializer = NULL)

\arguments{
\item{obj}{The object to generate a hash digest for}

\item{ref_serializer}{(optional) A serializer for reference-style
objects, see \code{\link{serialize}}}
}
\description{
Fast, memory constant hashing of R objects
}
\details{
\code{obj} will be hashed using R's internal serialization logic
with a custom target which applies applying Jenkins' SpookyHash (v2) in a
streaming fashion. This avoids (ever) copying the data out of the R object
itself, providing both speed and memory constancy.

It also guarantees that the "representation" of the R object being hashed
is the same as the serialized version would be, if created.
